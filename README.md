# Synthetic-Music-Generation-Using-Autoencoders
This project implements an autoencoder, a neural network architecture, to generate and reconstruct synthetic music data. The autoencoder is designed to compress high-dimensional music data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space) and then reconstruct it with minimal loss of information.
