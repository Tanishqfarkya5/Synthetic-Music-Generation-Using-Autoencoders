**Project Title:** Synthetic Music Generation Using Autoencoders  

**Description:**  
This project implements an autoencoder, a neural network architecture, to generate and reconstruct synthetic music data. The autoencoder is designed to compress high-dimensional music data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space) and then reconstruct it with minimal loss of information.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Data Simulation:** Randomly generated synthetic music samples with 64 features per sample to mimic musical attributes such as pitch, amplitude, and rhythm.  
- **Autoencoder Architecture:** Includes:
  - **Encoder:** Compresses input data (64 features) into a 32-dimensional latent space.  
  - **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original music data from the latent space using a dense neural network.  
- **Training:** Trains on 80% of the synthetic dataset while validating on the remaining 20%. Optimized using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error loss function.  
- **Output:** Generates compressed representations of music samples and reconstructs them to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.

**Applications:**  
- Useful for tasks such as music data compression, noise reduction, anomaly detection in audio signals, and generative music composition.  
- Serves as a foundation for exploring real-world datasets for advanced music generation.
